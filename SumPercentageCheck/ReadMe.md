This program is meant to be use an Excel spreadsheet as a database from which to perform calculations from. 
These calculations will determine if there is enough room in a "truck" to fit shipments. 
It is also a test of the Apache POI plugin which will allow Excel Calculations to be referenced in Java. 
I have included the spreadsheet that works with this program, it needs to be located on the desktop, but the filepath can be changed, as can the formulas in the column.

This was done as an interview test last year, which is why it is not more detailed.
